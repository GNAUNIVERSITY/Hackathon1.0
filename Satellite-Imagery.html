        <h2>Satellite Imagery</h2>
        <p>Agriculture is often viewed as an industry that is slow to change and antiquated in its practices While the agriculture industry is steeped in meaningful and important traditions and heritage however, it also has embraced leading technological advances and is employing them in innovative and powerful ways.
            There are many satellites that acquire multispectral images from space: the most common are Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 (both used in Agricolus platform), Planetscope and Sky Sat. The images obtained have a spatial resolution of a few meters: Landsat 8 provides data with a spatial resolution of 30 m, while Sentinel-2 of 10, 20 or 60 m (depending on the band), Planetscope of 3 m and SkySat of 1 m.
            The temporal resolution is in most cases regular. For example, Landsat 8 is available every 16 days, while Sentinel-2 is available every 3/5 days (depending on the zone). Planetscope and Skysat have a daily resolution.
            The regular passage of the satellites determines the availability of the data in several phases of the growing season, but it is also important to underline that during the satellite transit, where the area under examination is covered by clouds, the data is not usable.

        <div class="col-8"><p>Using Satellite Imagery for Remote Sensing
            Capturing images and spectral light measurements from space can be quite useful as a standalone product, but these data become incredibly powerful when they are combined with on the ground monitoring points. This process, known as remote sensing, is the process where satellite imagery data are matched with on the ground samples (such as weather station data, soil samples, vegetation surveys, etc.) to create condition estimates at various spatial scales. As a result, we can estimate conditions in locations where no on-the-ground measurement was taken. As technology continues to improve, the power and abilities of remote sensing are growing quickly.</p></div>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>One application of remote sensing products is the incorporation of precision agriculture into farm management. This is the process by which a farmer uses remote sensing as well as on-farm data and complex algorithms that convert these data into production estimates to inform input decisions, such as variable-rate fertilizer application rates or optimal watering amounts. The use of these methods is helping agricultural producers across the U.S be more strategic in their allocation of scarce or expensive resources and prioritize profit and sustainability simultaneously.
            Another area of ongoing research in remote sensing science is how to match on the ground soil organic carbon estimates with satellite imagery to best estimate changes in carbon stocks across time while minimizing the cost of on the ground sampling. These efforts are being explored by the carbon market companies, like Indigo Ag and Regen Network, as well as researchers and agency personnel from the USDA and universities around the globe.

            <div class="col-8"><h2>Harnessing the Power of Space</h2>
            <p>Remote sensing and satellite imagery data are being used around the globe by the agricultural industry to make decisions, understand changes, and estimate future conditions. Just like forecasting commodity price data, researchers and industry professionals are using these spatial data to forecast changes to conditions under different management strategies, climate scenarios, and market pressures.
                The technology around remote sensing is rapidly developing and there are new private industry actors and innovations all the time. For example, Planet Labs has recently launched derived data feeds at daily temporal resolution and 1-5 square meter spatial resolution for studying land cover change. As the spatial data available becomes less and less aggregated across time and space, and cloud computing and cloud storage capacities increase, remote sensing products are sure to see massive improvement in their capabilities and accuracy.
                As Farmtogether looks to buy and lease out different farming operations around the country, satellite imagery and remote sensing products prove important in these decisions for understanding historical management and conditions. Now, with the power of time-series satellite imagery and remote sensing products, the knowledge of the farm managers can be combined with satellite data to tell a complete history of the farm and give confidence to investors in the capacity of the operation.
                For individual farmers, as they grow in size, remote sensing technology is helping managers keep track of conditions and monitor growth, weather, and carbon with newfound ease and surprising accuracy. While these products arenâ€™t perfect, they are improving every day and making day to day farm management simpler and can help managers demonstrate their conservation and management efforts in an easily understandable and visually appealing way.
                Satellite imagery is changing the way business is done in the agricultural sector. Managers, researchers, and investors now all have access to data that can improve decision making and push the industry to a place of better soil health, more efficient production, and happier farmers.</p>

            <div class="col-8"><h2>Vegetation indices obtained by satellite</h2>
            <p>When talking about satellite images, and remote sensing in general, it is necessary to introduce the concept of vegetation index to understand how they allow the monitoring of the health of crops without the need to go to the field.
                Vegetation indexes are a key tool of Smart Farming: the use of satellite data and their correct interpretation reduce the interventions in the field and make sustainable, from the economic point of view, a structured crop scouting activity.
                The indices can describe the vigor of the plant, providing a measure of its general health, or specific problems such as water stress or the amount of chlorophyll.
                Types of vegetation indexes
                NDVI: it allows to evaluate the health of the vegetation, analyzing the reflectance of the vegetation in the Red and NIR bands.
                SAVI: allows to evaluate the conditions of vegetation development in the emergency and early stages of development, as it applies a correction to bare soil.
                LAI: leaf area index that estimates the leaf area of the plant expressed in m2 on m2.
                TCARI/OSAVI: specific index that allows to identify chlorotic areas within the field.
                WDRVI: it analyzes the health of the vegetation and is particularly useful when the vegetation is well developed and lush and the other vegetation indices tend to saturate.</p>
