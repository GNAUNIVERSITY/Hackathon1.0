        <h2>Drone Tech in Agriculture</h2>
    <p>Drones in agriculture are opening up new possibilities to increase their crop yield with better farming applications and real time access to information.Agriculture Drone Software have been used extensively in the commercial industry for the past many decades. The earliest commercial use of the ai drone technology may be traced back to the early 1980s, however, it is only in the past two decades that the practical applications of drones have expanded considerably. Owing to the advancement in technology, especially in futuristic technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and others, today drones are widely used across various industries; enabling faster, better, and more cost-effective.
      Drones in Agriculture and Farming
      There are plenty of drones applications in the agriculture industry. In fact, drones and agriculture are seen as the perfect match of how technology can revolutionize the traditional industries, making them better, more efficient, and productive for the collective benefit of humanity.</p>

            <p>How can drones support Indian agriculture? Drones don't merely enhance overall performance but also encourage farmers to solve other assorted barriers and receive plenty of benefits through precision agriculture. With the market for agricultural drones reaching a whopping $1.3 billion, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) fill the gap of human error and inefficiency by traditional farming methods. The purpose of adopting drone technology is to exclude any guesswork or ambiguity and instead focus on accurate and reliable information.
              External factors like weather, soil conditions, and temperature play a critical role in farming. Agriculture drone empowers the farmer to adapt to specific environments and make mindful choices accordingly. The gained data helps regulate crop health, crop treatment, crop scouting, irrigation, and carry out field soil analysis and crop damage assessments. The drone survey helps boost crop yields and minimize time and expenses.</p>

                    <p>Drones with their inherent capability to survey vast tracts of lands are perfect tools to perform terrain mapping. Today, companies like Folio3 are manufacturing AI drones that are programmable to perform various tasks including terrain mapping for better management of the agricultural industry.
                        Modern-day drones equipped with LiDAR and other sensors are used by farmers to map the terrain across vast swaths of lands as a reconnaissance tool for land preparations. The advanced computer vision capabilities of drones enable them to accurately map the terrain and offer real-time feedback to farmers for efficient planning and management of fields.</p></div>

                    <div class="col-8"><h2>Soil and Field Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Drones are great tools to access insightful data for the quality of the soil at the beginning or end of a crop cycle. AI drones equipped with LiDAR can be used to create 3D maps of the soil to be able to understand any issues with the quality of the soil including the nutrients or any dead zone.
                        All of this information can be pretty useful to determine the most effective planting patterns, as well as, improved crop management. Drones can also be sued to identify and monitor water resources more effectively across the fields.</p>

                    <div class="col-8"><h2>Seed Planting</h2>
                    <p>Seed planting using drone technology is a relatively new technology as compared to other drones applications in agriculture. However, startup companies have been testing the technology for faster and more effective seed plantations.
                        Some farming drone manufacturing companies are also testing the payload efficiency of drones in form of tree seeds, fertilizers, water, and herbicide to assess the cost-effectiveness of the technology. Once it gets passed the testing phase, drones would further strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the agriculture industry by making it much easier to plant seeds and deliver other required elements to the soil.</p></div>

                    <div class="col-8"><h2>Crop Spraying</h2>
                    <p>Another area of drones application in the agriculture industry includes crop spraying. Traditionally, farmers are required to spray the entire fields manually with vehicles or at times some farmers also used airplanes for the purpose. However, both of these methods are either too slow or too expensive for the liking of modern-day farming.
                        Today, smart drones approved by FAA can take huge reservoirs of fertilizers or pesticides as payload for efficient spraying across the field. In fact, AI drones can be programmed for spot spraying as well, making it much safer and cost-effective for farmers to manage the crop yields and stop pest infestation in crops.</p></div>

                    <div class="col-8"><h2>Crop Mapping and Surveying</h2>
                    <p>Another vital drone application in the agriculture sector is the use of the technology in monitoring of crops across vast swaths of fields. Traditionally this has to be performed by farmers manually which takes forever and is highly inefficient. More recently tech companies have been using satellite or airborne imagery to survey and map the crop fields, which again comes with high costs.
                        Lately, AI-powered drones have taken over the survey and mapping aspect of farming, making it possible for farmers to keep a close check on the crop efficiently in real-time.</p></div>

                    <div class="col-8"><h2>Irrigation Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>Another traditionally troublesome area for farmers has been monitoring and management of irrigation. With several miles long irrigation network, there’s always a possibility of issues arising.
                        Today, drones equipped with thermal imaging systems are effectively used to monitor the entire irrigation network efficiently and spot any issues in real-time. With access to real-time information through drones, farmers are in a better position to maximize the drainage and prepare contingency plans to cope with issues.</p></div>

                    <p>Lastly, drones are effectively used to monitor crop health. Drones equipped with infrared and thermal sensors are widely used to get real-time imagery for analysis of crop health.
                        Companies like Folio3 offer customized crop health monitoring software that can be used to instantly assess the chlorophyll content, as well as, estimate soil fertility through crop imagery in the infrared and thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p></div>

                    <p>Agricultural drones fitted along with multispectral sensors and RGB sensors also detect field areas inflicted by weeds, infections, and pests. According to this data, the exact amounts of chemicals needed to fight these infestations are known, and this helps diminish the costs inflicted by the farmer.
