            <h2>Small and Fragmented Land-holdings</h2>
            <p>When we consider that it is split into financially unsustainable small and dispersed holdings, the apparent plenty of net sown land of 141.2 million hectares and total cultivated area of 189.7 million hectares (1999-2000) disappears into insignificance. From 1970–1971 the average holding size was 2.28 hectares; this decreased to 1.82 hectares in 1980–1981,1.50 hectares in 1995–1996, and 1.08 hectares in 2015-2016. Also, the size of assets will continue to shrink as the land holdings are endlessly subdivided.
                
                In highly inhabited and actively farmed states where the average size of land holdings is less than one hectare and in some areas it is less than even 0.5 hectares, the issue of small and fragmented holdings is one of the major problems faced by Indian farmers. This results in a wide gap between small, medium, and big farmers. Our inheritance laws are the fundamental cause of this unfortunate situation. Each of the father's sons receives an equal share of the land, and this land distribution is scattered in nature rather than a collection or consolidation.</p>

            <h2>Seeds</h2>
          <p>A seed is an essential and fundamental ingredient to increase crop yields and maintain steady growth in agricultural output. The distribution of seeds of guaranteed quality is just as important as their manufacture. Unfortunately,  for the farmers, affording high-quality seeds due to the high cost of superior seeds is one of the major challenges of Indian agriculture.</p>

            <h2>Fertilisers and Manures</h2>
            <p>For thousands of years, crops have been grown on Indian soils without any concern for replenishment. This has caused soils to become exhausted and depleted, which has decreased their yield. Nearly all crops have some of the lowest average yields on the entire planet. More manures and fertilisers can be used to address this major issue.

                Manures and fertilisers serve the same purpose for soils as healthy food does for the human body. Nourished soil can yield good harvests, just as a well-nourished human can perform any competent task. According to estimates, increasing fertiliser application accounts for around 70% of growth in agricultural output. Thus, an indicator of agricultural prosperity is an increase in fertiliser usage. However, providing enough manures and fertilisers throughout a country the size of India is challenging, where low-income peasants populate. Chemical fertilisers are expensive and frequently out of the price range of small-scale farmers. Therefore, the fertiliser issue is both serious and intricate.</p>

        <div class="right-max" id="irrigation">
            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Only one-third of India's cropland is irrigated, although it is the world's second-largest irrigated nation after China. In a country with a tropical monsoon like India, where rainfall is unpredictable, unreliable, and variable, irrigation is the most crucial agricultural input. India won't be able to make significant agricultural advancements unless and until more than 50 per cent of the planted area is covered by reliable irrigation.</p>

            <h2>Lack of Mechanisation</h2>
            <p>Despite the massive mechanisation of agriculture in some regions of the nation, most agricultural operations are still conducted by hand in these areas, employing straightforward and traditional tools and implements like wooden ploughs, sickles, etc.

                Ploughing, seeding, irrigating, thinning and pruning, weeding, harvesting, threshing, and transporting crops all involve little to no usage of machinery. Particularly with small and marginal farms, this is the case. Large amounts of human labour are wasted as a result, and productivity per worker is low.</p>

        <div class="right-max" id="storage">
            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p>Storage facilities are either nonexistent or woefully inadequate in rural locations. In such circumstances, the farmers are obligated to sell their food as soon as it is harvested at the going market rates, which are invariably low. The farmers lose their rightful income as a result of these distressed sales. The Parse Committee calculated that 9.3% of post-harvest losses were attributable to poor storage conditions alone, accounting for approximately 6.6 per cent of those losses. Hence, it is crucial to use efficient storage to prevent losses and benefit both consumers and producers.</p>

            <h2>Capital</h2>
            <p>Agriculture is a significant industry; much like other industries, it needs money to operate. With the development of agricultural technology, the importance of capital input is growing. The agriculturalist must borrow money to increase the pace of agricultural output because his capital is tied up in his lands and stocks. Even now,  the money lenders, traders, and commission agents that charge exorbitant interest rates and buy agricultural products at extremely low prices are the main funding sources for farmers in rural areas.</p>
