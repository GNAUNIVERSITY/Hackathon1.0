        <h1 className="mytag">Social Responsibility for Individual Welfare</h1>
        <p>I am happy that in this remarkable conference that has been called to celebrate and to deepen the thinking
            and knowledge of our people throughout the country on these subjects, we should have the stress laid on this
            particular subject: “Social Responsibility for Individual Welfare.”

            Every woman is proud that the first woman to be in the Cabinet to head a Department of Social Welfare is
            Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby, and we know that she will have the backing of the women of this country in every
            struggle to really bring to the people of the country a greater sense of welfare and opportunity and justice
            in the life of our land.

            Now, it has come about that when you talk about the welfare state as a rule people think that that is a
            rather derogatory term—that a welfare state is somehow not a good thing. But if we could just change it
            around a little and say that we believed that society included the government, the individuals themselves as
            individuals, and all other groups—universities, the people who form the policies, the industrialists, the
            people who guide commerce, industry, and agriculture—if we thought of them altogether as working together to
            increase the welfare of the individual, then we would cease, I think, to have fear of just the mere words “a
            welfare state.” We would have a truer conception of what the words really mean.

            It is basic in a democracy that leadership for the welfare of the people as a whole must come from
            government. It is true that we pride ourselves on holding the reins of government, but we need leadership.
            We need a voice to define our aims, to put into words the things we want to achieve; and so we look to
            government to do just that—so that we do not stand still but move forward. Just as Alice in Wonderland had
            to run very fast to stay in the same place, we must run even faster to stay in the same place, and we have
            to do even more in order to go forward. We will go backward unless we go forward.</p>
